# life-insurance-churn-analysis

### Project overview

This project uses R to explore the key drivers of customer churn in life insurance. Since all policies in the dataset had a fixed one-year term, the analysis focuses on variables that provide meaningful insights—age, annual premium, sales channel, gender, risk zone, and city. Using data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and churn-rate calculations, the project identifies which customer groups and channels have the highest likelihood of churn. The results highlight how demographic factors, premium levels, and distribution channels influence churn behavior. These insights can help insurers strengthen retention strategies, target at-risk customers, and improve long-term customer value.
